        It's a collection of 16,888 unique skills. Why this number? It is a sum of Loot and N NFTs.
        </p>
        <p>
        The 4,000 are reserved for the Loot project and 4,000 for the N project holders and can be claimed just for a gas. The rest 8,888 can be minted for 0,01 ETH and the gas fee. 
        <br />
        <br />Please remember, if the first 8,000 token are minted the 8,000 pool reserved for Loot and N holder start decreasing. For example, if 10,888 token are minted and there are 6,000 remaining the Loot and N project holders
        can still claim 6,000 tokens just for the gas but not the max amount reserved, 4,000 for each project. That means for example, the Loot holders can claim 3,500 and 2,500 can be claimed by the N project holders.

        The drawn skills are a randomly generated set of spells and talents, which ensures uniqueness. They do not always contain the same number of talents and spells. It is up to us how we want to classify them. We don't want to create any rules, restrictions and limitations. We are free to use and combine them however we want. Let our imagination speak and build something great and unique by mixing all of the Loot related NFTs.

        Even with our traveller's equipment we are not always ready to set off on an adventure. Enemies, creatures and other difficulties can cause us a lot of troubles. Spell & Talent provide us the necessary skills that support us during our adventure. With those skills it will be much easier to overcome problems. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It is not just about ourselves, our friends can also help by possessing the other set of skills. Together we are stronger!
        </p>
        <p>
        The connection with N Project can provide us with even greater power. We can use numbers to increase the effectiveness of the Spell & Talent bags. Although, this is just a vision and the beauty is that the connection can be used however your imagination tells you! Pure freedom!

        Spell & Talent can only be claimed once by Loot and N project NFT. It is enough to provide the ID from the loot. The remaining can be minted by anyone.
