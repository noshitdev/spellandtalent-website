        It's a collection of 16,000 unique skills. 
        </p>
        <p>
        4,000 are currently reserved for the Loot project and 4,000 for the N project holders. They can claim them for just gas. The rest 7,700 can be minted for 0,02 ETH and gas fee. The remaining 300 bags are reserved for the developers and maintainers.
        </p>
        <p>
        The drawn skills are a randomly generated set of spells and talents, which ensures uniqueness. They do not always contain the same number of talents and spells. It is up to us how we want to classify them. We don't want to create any rules, restrictions and limitations. We are free to use and combine them however we want. Let our imagination speak and build something great and unique by mixing all of the Loot related NFTs.

        <p>
        Even with our traveller's equipment we are not always ready to set off on an adventure. Enemies, creatures and other difficulties can cause us a lot of troubles. Spell & Talent provide us the necessary skills that support us during our adventure. With those skills it will be much easier to overcome problems. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It is not just about ourselves, our friends can also help by possessing the other set of skills. Together we are stronger!
        </p>
        <p>
        The connection with N Project can provide us with even greater power. We can use numbers to increase the effectiveness of the Spell & Talent bags. Although, this is just a vision and the beauty is that the connection can be used however your imagination tells you! Pure freedom!

    question: 'How can I get Spell & Talent?',
    content: () => (
      <div>
        <p>
        Spell & Talent can only be claimed once by Loot and N project NFT. It is enough to provide the ID from the loot. The remaining can be minted by anyone.
